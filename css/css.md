# Base Two Front End Standards #

## CSS ##
Regardless of how the CSS is compiled (Sass, LESS, vanilla, etc), it should follow all the following standards.

### Alphabetization ###
We alphabetize our declarations within a declaration block. This is useful for a few reasons:

 1. Declarations are easier to find...
 2. And harder to duplicate
 3. Everything is always in the same order

```
.example {
  background: #000;
  border: 0;
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 1em;
  z-index: 100;
}
```

> **Note:**
> There are some Sass-related exceptions to this rule, which are covered in the SASS SECTION LINK HERE PLS

### Line Returns ###
Each selector and declaration should be on its own line.

```
#too, .many, .selectors .on .the, .same.line { content: "incorrect!"; }

#this,
.is .the,
.correct.way {
  content: "much better!";
}
```

### Value Formatting ###
Omit the leading 0 on fractions:`.7em` instead of `0.7em`

Omit the unit for zero values:
```
.incorrect {
  padding: 0em 2em;
}

.correct {
  padding: 0 2em;
}
```

Use shorthand wherever possible:

```
.incorrect {
  border-color: blue blue transparent blue;
  margin: 0 auto 0;
}

.correct {
  border-color: blue blue transparent;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

### Whitespace ###

There should always be a space after colons and commas and before the opening curly brace of a declaration block.
```
.spaces--incorrect{
  color:rgb(0,0,0);
}

.spaces--correct {
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}
```

## Sass ##

### Declaration Order ###
Declarations should still be in alphabetical order in all .SCSS files. However, all `@extend` and `@include` declarations should be listed first.

```
.incorrect {
  border: 1px solid;
  @include border-radius(5px);
  color: #000;
  @extend %button;
}

.incorrect {
  @include border-radius(5px);
  @extend %button;
  border: 1px solid;
  color: #000;
}
```

### Nesting ###
In accordance with the [Inception Rule](http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule), styles nested more than four levels deep should not pass a code review without justification.
