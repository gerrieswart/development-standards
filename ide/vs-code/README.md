## Packages

### ESLint & Prettier

#### eslint-plugin-prettier

Runs [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) as an [ESLint](http://eslint.org) rule and reports differences as individual ESLint issues.

#### eslint-config-prettier

Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with [Prettier].

This lets you use your favorite shareable config without letting its stylistic choices get in the way when using Prettier.

Note that this config _only_ turns rules _off,_ so it only makes sense using it together with some other config.

#### eslint-plugin-node

Additional ESLint's rules for Node.js

A code analysis tool for identifying and reporting problematic patterns in Javascript.

#### eslint-config-node

Pluggable ESLint config for Node.js that you can import, extend and override
