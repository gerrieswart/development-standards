## Install ESLint & Prettier for VSCode

Open Extensions menu in VSCode, and Search for `EsLint` and `Prettier`, and install. Or install from The extension marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

### Install Packages

- Open a command line tool, `crt + j` inside VSCode.
- Run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file
- Run `npm i -D eslint prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier` to install as a dev dependency.

Optional additional packages that can be included in the above install:

- Airbnb's ESLint rules, including ECMAScript 6+ and React `npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb` OR if you don't want React `npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb-base`
- React specific linting rules for ESLint `npm install eslint-plugin-react --save-dev`

### Create ESLint Config

- Run `eslint --init` and follow command prompts to create [.eslintrc.js](/.eslintrc.js)
- Remove all generated code except for `extends` and `rules`
- Add `plugins` to exports, and include the `prettier` plugin.
- Include `prettier/prettier` in the rules
- Reference [eslintrc.js](/.eslintrc.js)

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["airbnb", "prettier"],
  plugins: ["prettier"],
  rules: {
    "prettier/prettier": "error",
  },
};
```

### Create Prettier Config

- Add `"prettier/prettier": "error",` to the rules in the [.eslintrc.js](/.eslintrc.js)
- If a local set of prettier rules is needed
  - In root of project create a file named `.prettierrc` for prettier rules
  - [Prettier rules can be found here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html)
